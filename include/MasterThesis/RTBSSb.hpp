         * @brief This class represents the RTBSSb online planner for belief dependent reward POMDPs.
         *
         * This algorithm is an online planner for POMDPs. It works by pretty
         * much solving the whole POMDP in a straightforward manner, but just
         * for the belief it is currently in, and the horizon specified.
         *
         * Additionally, it uses an heuristic function in order to prune
         * branches which cannot possibly help in determining which action is
         * the actual best. Currently this heuristic is very crude, as it
         * requires the user to manually input a maximum possible reward, and
         * using it as an upper bound.
         *
         * Additionally, in theory one would want to explore branches from the
         * most promising to the least promising, to maximize pruning. This is
         * currently not done here, since an heuristic is intrinsically
         * determined by a particular problem. At the same time, it is easy to
         * add one, as the code specifies where one should be inserted.
         *
         * This method is able to return not only the best available action,
         * but also the (in theory) true value of that action in the current
         * belief.  Note that values computed in different methods may differ
         * due to floating point approximation errors.
         * 
         * This class is different from RTBSS in that it takes a function that
         * computes reward directly from the beliefs encountered.
